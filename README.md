# Premier Model (Old Version) – Responsive HTML & CSS Clone

This is a **fully responsive** clone of the *old version* of the Premier Model Management website. Built using only **HTML and CSS**, this project is part of my web development practice and focuses on creating clean, responsive layouts without any frameworks or JavaScript.

> ⚠️ Note: The current Premier website has changed. This clone is based on their **previous design**.
